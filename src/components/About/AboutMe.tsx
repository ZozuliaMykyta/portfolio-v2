      <p className="text-white">
        I'm Mykyta â€” a Full-Stack MERN developer with almost 4 years of
        experience. I started with frontend and, driven by a desire to bring my
        own ideas to life on the web, I expanded into backend technologies to
        build end-to-end products. I took a short break to enroll in university,
        then returned to development and have been actively coding since.
        <br />
        <br /> I've had freelance experience, iterating quickly from concept to
        deployment. I've also built small websites for students as separate
        projects. I focus on clean, maintainable code, performance, and a
        thoughtful user experience.
